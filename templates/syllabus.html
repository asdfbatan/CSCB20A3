Web documents and applications: static and interactive documents; Web servers and dynamic server-generated content; Web application development and interface with databases.
    <h3>Required background</h3>
    Some experience with programming in an imperative language such as Python, Java or C. This course may not be taken after - or concurrently with - any C- or D-level CSC course.

        <li>Instructor: A. Attarwala</li>

        <li>Class website: Quercus</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Text Books</h3>
    For a course like this, no single textbook will represent the course expectations well. However, what I will do is provide you weekly reading material (some of which will be mandatory) from other universities, and other places from the web. This material will supplement well with what is taught in the class.
    <h3>Lecture Notes</h3>
    Lecture notes will be available on Blackboard. You are EXPECTED to read the assigned readings before coming to lecture.
    <h3>Quizzes</h3>
    You will have around 24hours or less to work on the quizzes. Quizzes will not happen in lecture, and you can work on these quizzes outside the classroom. However, explicit instructions will be provided on how you would submit these quizzes to us. More details on the submission instructions will be made available in due time.
    <h3>Assignments</h3>
    There are three assignments. You may be asked to work in pairs in some of these assignments. Please check the assignment handout for these details for the exact due date and whether you can work in groups or not. DO NOT EMAIL YOUR ASSIGNMENTS TO US. We will use MARKUS for the submission of all assignments. ALL AS- SIGNMENTS WILL MARKED ON UTSC LAB MACHINES. IT IS IMPORTANT BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR ASSIGNMENT, TO MAKE SURE THAT IT COMPILES AND EXECUTES ON THE UTSC LAB MACHINES. A STRICT silent policy takes effect 12 hours before an ASSIGNMENT or EXAM is due. This means no question about the assignment will be answered by the instructor or the TA whether it is asked on the bulletin board, by email or in person. I will make sure to follow the due dates mentioned in the course syllabus, however, if the due dates on the assignment handout differ from this course syllabus handout, the due dates on the assignment handout will supersede.
    <h3>Remark</h3>
    If a piece of work has been mismarked or if you believe the rubric used to evaluate the work is not appropriate, you may request a remark. For a re-mark to succeed, you must clearly and concisely express what you believe was mis-marked or unfairly marked. To request a remark, set up an appointment with the instructor and the TA that has marked your assignment/exam. PLEASE DO NOT USE THE DISCUSSION BOARD REQUESTING FOR REMARKS. Be prepared for the entire work to be re-evaluated and for the mark to be adjusted up or down after the re-evaluation. Remark request MUST be made in three regular days after the mark is made available. No remark request will be accepted after three regular days.
    <h3>Tutorials</h3>
    During tutorials, attendance is mandatory, and on some occasions, the TA will take attendance and assign you small in lab exercises. Tutorials are a great way for you to get some hands-on practice at programming. There is no labs/tutorial scheduled in the first week. All tutorials begin from the 2nd week of the semester. We will award the tutorial marks based on attendance. However, in some tutorials, TA’s may also assign you small component, and on successfully completing this component, you will be assigned full credit for that lab. So it is important that you attend these tutorials and not skip them!
    <h3>Final Exam</h3>
    There is a 2hrs (or maybe 3hrs) final exam. The final exam is comprehensive, and you must obtain a mark of at least 40% to pass the course; otherwise, a grade of no higher than 47% will be assigned.
    <h3>Late Policy</h3>
    There are no grace days; all due dates are firm. In case of illness, please have a doctor complete an official U of T medical certificate. For other emergencies, be prepared for us to request some documentation. If you submit an assignment late or miss a midterm test due to illness or personal issue, first contact the instructor as soon as possible. Then, please follow the procedure described <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/aacc/petitions">here. </a>
    For coursework petitions, a Petition Form for Term Work form needs to be filled and given to the course instructor. This will not be accepted if submitted two days after the due date.
